// Certainly! Below is a complex example of how the Facade design pattern can be implemented in Go. In this example, let's consider a complex subsystem related to a travel booking system that includes multiple components such as flight booking, hotel reservation, and car rental. The TravelFacade will act as a simplified interface to these subsystems.

// Copy
package main

import "fmt"

// FlightBookingSubsystem
type FlightBooking struct {
}

func (fb *FlightBooking) bookFlight(destination string) {
	fmt.Printf("Booking a flight to %s\n", destination)
}

// HotelReservationSubsystem
type HotelReservation struct {
}

func (hr *HotelReservation) reserveHotel(city string, nights int) {
	fmt.Printf("Reserving a hotel in %s for %d nights\n", city, nights)
}

// CarRentalSubsystem
type CarRental struct {
}

func (cr *CarRental) rentCar(city string, days int) {
	fmt.Printf("Renting a car in %s for %d days\n", city, days)
}

// TravelFacade
type TravelFacade struct {
	flightBooking     *FlightBooking
	hotelReservation  *HotelReservation
	carRental         *CarRental
}

func NewTravelFacade() *TravelFacade {
	return &TravelFacade{
		flightBooking:    &FlightBooking{},
		hotelReservation: &HotelReservation{},
		carRental:        &CarRental{},
	}
}

func (tf *TravelFacade) PlanTrip(destination string, nights int, days int) {
	tf.flightBooking.bookFlight(destination)
	tf.hotelReservation.reserveHotel(destination, nights)
	tf.carRental.rentCar(destination, days)
}

func main() {
	// Client code using the TravelFacade
	travelFacade := NewTravelFacade()

	// Plan a trip to Paris with 3 nights stay and 5 days car rental
	travelFacade.PlanTrip("Paris", 3, 5)

	// Plan a trip to New York with 2 nights stay and 4 days car rental
	travelFacade.PlanTrip("New York", 2, 4)
}
// In this example:

// FlightBooking, HotelReservation, and CarRental represent complex subsystems related to travel.
// TravelFacade is the facade class that provides a simplified interface to these subsystems.
// The PlanTrip method in the TravelFacade class coordinates the interactions with the subsystems to plan a trip.
// The client code can use the TravelFacade to plan trips without dealing with the intricacies of flight booking, hotel reservation, and car rental. The Facade pattern helps to simplify the usage of complex subsystems by providing a higher-level, unified interface.

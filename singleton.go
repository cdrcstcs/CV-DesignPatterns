// In Go, a common way to implement a singleton pattern is to use a package-level variable. Since Go doesn't have traditional classes or constructors, a singleton can be achieved by declaring a package-level variable and initializing it once.

// Here's an example of a singleton pattern in Go:

// Copy
package singleton

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// Singleton is a struct representing the singleton instance
type Singleton struct {
	data string
}

// instance is the package-level variable to hold the singleton instance
var instance *Singleton

// once is used for lazy initialization to ensure that the instance is created only once
var once sync.Once

// getInstance returns the singleton instance, creating it if necessary
func getInstance() *Singleton {
	once.Do(func() {
		instance = &Singleton{
			data: "Initialized Singleton Data",
		}
	})
	return instance
}

// GetData retrieves the data from the singleton instance
func GetData() string {
	singletonInstance := getInstance()
	return singletonInstance.data
}

// SetData sets the data in the singleton instance
func SetData(newData string) {
	singletonInstance := getInstance()
	singletonInstance.data = newData
}

func main() {
	// Use the singleton instance
	fmt.Println("Initial Data:", GetData())

	// Set new data in the singleton instance
	SetData("New Singleton Data")

	// Retrieve and print the updated data
	fmt.Println("Updated Data:", GetData())
}
In this example:

Singleton is a struct representing the singleton instance.
instance is a package-level variable holding the singleton instance.
once is a sync.Once variable used for lazy initialization, ensuring that the instance is created only once.
getInstance is a function that returns the singleton instance, creating it if necessary.
GetData and SetData are functions to interact with the singleton instance's data.
This example uses the sync.Once package to achieve thread-safe and efficient lazy initialization. The GetInstance function is called whenever the singleton instance is needed, and it ensures that the initialization logic is executed only once.

Remember, in Go, the usage of package-level variables and functions is often favored over traditional classes and singletons, promoting a simpler and more explicit code structure.

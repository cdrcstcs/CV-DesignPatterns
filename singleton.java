// Sure, here's an example of a Singleton design pattern implemented in Java. In this example, the Singleton ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

// Copy
public class Singleton {
    
    // Private static instance variable
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private Singleton() {
        // Initialization code, if any
    }
    
    // Public method to provide global access to the singleton instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        // Lazy initialization: create the instance only if it doesn't exist
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties of the singleton class
    public void doSomething() {
        System.out.println("Singleton instance is doing something.");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Get the singleton instance
        Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
        
        // Use the singleton instance
        singleton.doSomething();
    }
}
Explanation:

The Singleton class has a private static instance variable and a private constructor to prevent external instantiation.
The getInstance() method is used to obtain the singleton instance. It uses lazy initialization, creating the instance only if it doesn't exist.
The synchronized block inside getInstance() ensures thread safety during the creation of the singleton instance in a multi-threaded environment.
The doSomething() method represents some functionality that the singleton class provides.
This example ensures that only one instance of the Singleton class is created, and it provides a globally accessible method (getInstance()) to obtain that instance.

Note: While the classic Singleton pattern, as shown here, ensures a single instance, there are other approaches to achieve similar goals in Java, such as using the enum type or the Bill Pugh Singleton pattern, which addresses some issues with the classic implementation. The choice depends on the specific requirements and considerations of your application.

// Certainly! Here's an example of the Factory Method design pattern implemented in Go:

// Copy
package main

import "fmt"

// Product interface
type Car interface {
	Drive()
}

// Concrete products
type Sedan struct{}

func (s *Sedan) Drive() {
	fmt.Println("Driving a Sedan")
}

type SUV struct{}

func (s *SUV) Drive() {
	fmt.Println("Driving an SUV")
}

// Creator interface
type CarFactory interface {
	CreateCar() Car
}

// Concrete creators
type SedanFactory struct{}

func (sf *SedanFactory) CreateCar() Car {
	return &Sedan{}
}

type SUVFactory struct{}

func (suvf *SUVFactory) CreateCar() Car {
	return &SUV{}
}

// Client code
func main() {
	sedanFactory := &SedanFactory{}
	sedan := sedanFactory.CreateCar()
	sedan.Drive()

	suvFactory := &SUVFactory{}
	suv := suvFactory.CreateCar()
	suv.Drive()
}
In this example:

Car is the product interface that declares the common method Drive.
Sedan and SUV are concrete product structs that implement the Car interface.
CarFactory is the creator interface that declares the factory method CreateCar.
SedanFactory and SUVFactory are concrete creator structs that implement the CarFactory interface and provide the specific implementation of the CreateCar method.
The client code demonstrates how different factories (creators) can be used to create specific types of cars (products). The factories encapsulate the logic for creating objects, allowing the client code to be decoupled from the actual class instantiation.

This example illustrates how the Factory Method pattern can be applied in Go to create various types of cars without modifying the existing client code. The client can easily switch between creating Sedans and SUVs by using the appropriate factory.
